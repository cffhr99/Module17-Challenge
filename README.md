# Module17-Challenge:Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview:
The project used the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms were used to oversample the data and ClusterCentroids algorithm was used to undersample the data. Furthermore, a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling used the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier were compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias to predict credit risk.
## Results:
